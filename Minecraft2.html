    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>This page provides some information on Minecraft. Minecraft is a game that has been around for over a decade now.
      It is developed by Mojang, a Swedish video game developer that is now owned by Microsoft. In Minecraft, the objective is really up to you.
      But the basic premise of the game is that you mine and place blocks.
      You can choose from several gamemodes, but the main ones are survival and creative. There are three different dimensions in Minecraft:
      the overwold, the Nether, and the End. These can be traveled to and from using portals.</p>

    <h3>The Gamemodes</h3>
      <h4>Survival</h4>
      <p>There are 4 main difficulties: peaceful, easy, normal, and hard.
        You can be killed by the environment. This consists of things like monsters, drowning, and explosions.
        On peaceful mode, your health regenerates quickly and hostile mobs will not spawn. Choose this gamemode
        if you want more of a challenging experience with clearer game progression.</p>
      <h4>Creative</h4>
      <p>This mode is more about having the freedom to build whatever you want without any distractions.
        Some key features of creative mode are that you get unlimited blocks and items, you can fly, and you cannot be killed.
        Choose this gamemode if you would like to be able to build and experiment in whatever way you like without the challenge of survival.</p>
    <h3>Overworld</h3>
    <p>The overworld is the main dimension of Minecraft. It is where you spawn when you first start the game and likely where you will spend most of your time.
      Here, you can find the most important resources of the game, such as wood, animals, and underground resources.
      A common animal you will encounter in this dimension is the pig. These drop raw porkchops when killed. You can cook them in a furnace, making them much
      more effective at refilling hunger.</p>

    <h3>Nether</h3>
    <p>The Nether is the second dimension you will encounter if playing on survival mode. This dimension is full of hostile mobs that are often more difficult to
      kill than those in the overworld. Some of the mobs in the Nether include Ghasts, Blazes, and Hoglins. Despite the Nether being a challenging dimension,
      there are some very valuable resources that can help you in the game. Here are a few of them:</p>
    <ul class="l2">
      <li>Nether Wart
        <ul>
          <li>This can be found in Nether Fortresses. It is a key ingredient in potion-making. Potions can provide a variety of temporary buffs such as
            increased speed or strength, slow falling, and water breathing.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Blaze Powder
        <ul>
          <li>Also found in Nether Fortesses, blaze powder is obtained by killing blazes.
            It can be used to make eye of enders, which help you find the stronghold (where the end portal is located).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>End</h3>
    <p>The End's main attraction is the Ender Dragon. The Ender Dragon is a boss which requires great preparation in order to defeat. Upon killing the dragon, a large amount of experience is awarded to the player.
